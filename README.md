# Gun Violence
A place to store data and analysis around gun violence, subject to time constraints.

Dr. Lott has provided a public link to his book ["More Guns, Less Crime"](https://crimeresearch.org/data/) in the form of STATA `.do` files. Unsurprisingly, these can be [opened by R](https://kb.iu.edu/d/azuw) and I'm to have that chance soon.

It's no secret that I am critical of Dr. Lott's work.  But, Dr. Lott, if you're reading this, I am looking forward to meaningful, respectful and fact-based debate.  With your permission I will make my R, Python or Chapel scripts available in this repository.
